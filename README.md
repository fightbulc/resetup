# RESETUP

An unfortunate truth.

## What to do?

Did you get a fresh new machine or reinstalled everything from the ground up because the nvidia driver blocked you? Look no further!

## Steps

1. Clone the repository at `~/setup` folder
2. Run `./unpack` by entering your password
3. Wait until all tasks have been processed
4. Done

## What about updates?

If your update anything config related you need to run `./pack` with your password to rebuild your secrets.
Anything else is just part of the repo so go ahead and adjust the scripts and push the updates.

## Why no ansible?

I needed something right now and could not wait until I figured out how ansible works. I am sure it would be a better tool for this job but for the moment this helps to get me up and running fast respectively faster than before.
